This website is a masterpiece of art and technology, providing a platform for online learning. It has been meticulously crafted using the popular MERN stack, ensuring a seamless and powerful user experience. One of the key features of this website is its login and register pages, which are powered by Firebase authentication, offering robust security and ease of access for users.

Within this vibrant online community, there are three distinct roles: students, instructors, and administrators. Each role plays a crucial part in shaping the learning journey. The instructors, who possess deep knowledge and expertise in their respective fields, have the privilege of adding new classes to the website.

However, before a class becomes accessible to students, it goes through a careful process. In the first stage, the class is marked as pending, waiting for further action. This is where the administrators step in. They diligently review and evaluate the class, ensuring its alignment with the website's standards and objectives.

Once an administrator approves a class, it magically comes to life, showcasing its brilliance on the Classes page. This meticulous approval process guarantees that students are exposed only to the highest quality content, curated by passionate instructors and endorsed by knowledgeable administrators.
